# Gear3Engine

This is the issue tracker for Gear3Engine and it's derivative games. The engine was abstracted from Saucers.Space, and this issue tracker was originally configured to track Saucers.Space bugs and features. As the game evolved into an engine, more and more of the issues became engine-related.

Many parts of the engine will be made open source. Subscribe to my YouTube account for details. https://youtube.com/joshsideris/
